# Search_engine
This project is a very simplified version of a search engine. The goal is to find the most persistent results from a query.

### How to execute the model
We start by loading the data in the data folder using the *Data_loading.py* file. 
Once finished we then move to process the data by cleaning the texts from punctuations and insgnificant words, we also do lemmatization wich leaves us with the main part of each word. This will allow us to leave only the significant words
